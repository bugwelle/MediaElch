originalTitle: The Godfather
overview:
    In 1945, while his daughter Connie is getting married to Carlo Rizzi, Vito Corle
    one, the Don of the Corleone family in New York City, listens to requests. The r
    eception is where Vito's youngest son, Michael, a Marine and World War II hero w
    ho has so far avoided involvement in the family business, presents his girlfrien
    d, Kay Adams. Vito's godson, well-known singer Johnny Fontane, asks Vito for ass
    istance in landing a film role. To convince Jack Woltz, the studio president, to
     give Johnny the role, Vito dispatches his consigliere Tom Hagen. Woltz initiall
    y rejects Hagen's request, but after discovering the severed head of his beloved
     stud horse in his bed, he eventually gives in.

Drug lord Virgil "The Turk" Sol
    lozzo appeals to Vito to invest in his drug business and provide police protecti
    on as Christmas draws near. Vito refuses, saying that he would lose his politica
    l network if he got involved in drug use. Vito sends his enforcer Luca Brasi on 
    an espionage mission to the Tattaglias because he suspects Sollozzo of having a 
    relationship with the Tattaglia crime family. At the first meeting, Brasi is kil
    led by garroting. Officers later shoot Vito and force Hagen to attend a meeting.
     Now that Vito's firstborn son Sonny is in charge, Sollozzo puts pressure on Hag
    en to convince Sonny to agree to the drug deal. After NYPD officers on Sollozzo'
    s payroll remove Vito's guards, Michael visits him in the hospital after he surv
    ives the shooting and discovers that he is unprotected. When Michael stops his f
    ather's murder attempt, dishonest police captain Mark McCluskey beats him. Sonny
     hits Bruno Tattaglia in retaliation for the attempted hit at the hospital. In o
    rder to resolve the conflict, Sollozzo and McCluskey ask to meet with Michael. A
    fter pretending to be interested and agreeing to meet, Michael plans to kill Son
    ny and Corleone capo Clemenza and then disappears. At a restaurant in the Bronx,
     Michael meets Sollozzo and McCluskey. He takes out a gun that Clemenza had hidd
    en in the restroom and kills both men.

The Five Families engage in open warfare
     in spite of the government's crackdown on the murder of a police captain. Moe G
    reene provides sanctuary for Vito's second son Fredo in Las Vegas, while Michael
     seeks safety in Sicily. Michael meets and weds Apollonia, a local, in Sicily. C
    arlo is publicly attacked and threatened by Sonny for mistreating Connie physica
    lly. Sonny rushes to their house after he mistreats her once more, but gangsters
     ambush and kill him at a highway toll booth. Michael is the target of a car bom
    b that kills Apollonia shortly after.

Vito arranges a meeting with the Five Fam
    ilies because he is weary of war and devastated by Sonny's passing. He promises 
    them he will stop opposing their drug trade and that he will not seek revenge fo
    r Sonny's death. With his safety assured, Michael goes back to his hometown to m
    arry Kay and start the family business. At the beginning of the 1950s, Kay gives
     birth to two children. Michael takes over as the head of the Corleone family si
    nce his father is dying and Fredo is not fit to be the leader. Michael is inform
    ed by Vito that Don Barzini ordered the hit on Sonny and that Barzini would atte
    mpt to kill him during a meeting that a traitor Corleone capo had set up. Since 
    Hagen is not a "wartime consigliere," Michael assigns him to oversee operations 
    in Las Vegas with Vito's help. Michael is devastated to discover that Fredo is m
    ore devoted to Greene than to his own family when he goes to Las Vegas to purcha
    se Greene's share in the family's casinos.

While playing with Michael's son Ant
    hony in 1955, Vito suffers a heart attack and passes away. Tessio betrays Michae
    l by asking him to meet with Barzini at Vito's funeral. The meeting is scheduled
     for the same day as Connie's baby's baptism. The dons of the Five Families are 
    killed by Corleone hit men, along with Greene for failing to sell his hotel and 
    Tessio for betraying Michael, while Michael stands at the baptismal font as the 
    child's godfather. Michael coerces Carlo into confessing to his role in Sonny's 
    killing. He tells Carlo that he is not being killed but rather banished. Carlo c
    onfesses, but shortly after, Clemenza chokes him in a car. With Kay present, Con
    nie questions Michael about his role in Carlo's demise. Kay is relieved when Mic
    hael denies responsibility when she asks him if he ordered Carlo's death. Capos 
    enter the office and honor Michael as "Don Corleone" as she departs.

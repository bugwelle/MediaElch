overview:
    In the near future, aliens identified as Kaijus have risen from a portal in a cr
    evasse beneath the Pacific Ocean and started to attack coastal cities resulting 
    in a war that takes millions of lives and quickly consumes humanity's resources.
     To combat the monsters, a special type of weapon is designed: massive, humanoid
     fighting machines, known as Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two
     pilots whose minds are bound in a neural link (Through a process known as Drift
    ing) which lets them share the mental strain which would otherwise overwhelm a s
    ingle pilot.

The Jaegers are initially successful in fending off Kaiju attacks;
     however, over time, Kaijus cross through the portal at a faster rate, with each
     new Kaiju adapted for fighting the Jaegers. As they become less effective, Eart
    h's united governments lose faith in the Jaegers' ability. Five years later, the
     Jaeger program is terminated, with resources diverted to building a coastal for
    tification to protect coastal cities. Kaiju attack frequency is increasing, and 
    Jaegers are being destroyed faster than they can be built. The walls quickly pro
    ve ineffective.

The four remaining Jaegers are redeployed to Hong Kong to defen
    d the unfortified coastline until the wall can be completed. Stacker Pentecost (
    Idris Elba), commander of the Jaeger forces, devises a plan to end the war by us
    ing a nuclear warhead to destroy the portal (the breach at the bottom of the oce
    an from which the Kaijus cross over from their world to Earth), despite unsucces
    sful previous attempts.

In 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot the Am
    erican Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju code-na
    med Knifehead, who severely damages Gipsy, killing Yancy. Raleigh kills Knifehea
    d and pilots Gipsy solo to shore before collapsing. Traumatized by the loss of h
    is brother and the stress of piloting alone, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program.


    Pentecost approaches retired pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and convinces
     him to return and pilot Gipsy Danger, the Jaeger he and his brother Yancy (Dieg
    o Klattenhoff) once piloted. Raleigh, now working in wall construction, is recru
    ited by Pentecost for the mission of blowing up the breach.

Four Jaegers remain
     operational - the refurbished Gipsy Danger, the Russian Cherno Alpha (Sasha (Ro
    bert Maillet) and Alexis Kaidanovsky (Heather Doerksen) from Russia piloting), t
    he Chinese Crimson Typhoon (The Wei Tang Triplets from China (Charles Luu, Lance
     Luu and Mark Luu) piloting), and the Australian Striker Eureka piloted by fathe
    r-and-son team, Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky) and his father Hercules Hansen (M
    ax Martini). Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins Jr.) is a Jaeger technician of Chinese 
    and South American descent.

Arriving at Hong Kong, Raleigh tests with potential
     co-pilots to find one with a strong connection, as the stronger the connection,
     the better their performance in battle. Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, the
     director of the Jaeger restoration program. Sensing a strong connection, Raleig
    h demands to be partnered with Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). As a result, Pentecost
     grounds Mako. Raleigh calls out Pentecost on this. Pentecost reveals he adopted
     Mako after her parents were lost in the Kaiju attack.

The duo's initial test r
    un nearly ends in disaster when Mako gets caught up in a childhood memory of a K
    aiju attack; she inadvertently activates and nearly discharges Gipsy Danger's pr
    imary weapon, The Plasma Cannon, while in the hangar. The duo is withdrawn from 
    the field as the remaining Jaegers are tasked with fending off a double Kaiju at
    tack in Hong Kong. The defense goes badly, with the Kaijus destroying two Jaeger
    s, Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha, and disabling a third Jaeger, Striker Eurek
    a. Pentecost sends Raleigh and Mako to mount a last stand, and the duo drive off
     the assault.

Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gott
    lieb. Hermann claims the Breach will stabilize and the Kaiju will increase in nu
    mber, but this will allow the assault to succeed. Meanwhile, Dr. Newton Geiszler
     (Charlie Day), a scientist studying the Kaijus, assembles a machine allowing hi
    m to establish a mental link with a Kaiju brain fragment. The experience nearly 
    kills him, but he discovers the Kaijus are actually artificial weapons sent to E
    arth as an invading force to allow another species to colonize the planet.

With
     Pentecost's approval, he seeks out Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman), a major figure 
    in the trafficking of Kaiju parts, in an attempt to procure an intact Kaiju brai
    n to repeat the experiment. Chau criticizes Geiszler's merging with the Kaiju br
    ain, as he has attracted their attention, and the Kaiju attacking Hong Kong are 
    seeking him. Newton realizes the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his brain, sin
    ce drifting is a two-way link, and the two newest Kaiju to emerge in Hong Kong, 
    Leatherback and Otachi, are sent simultaneously to find him in Hong Kong.

All J
    aegers except Gipsy Danger are dispatched to intervene. Otachi destroys Crimson 
    Typhoon, while Leatherback destroys Cherno Alpha and disables Striker Eureka wit
    h an EMP blast, injuring Herc. As the only non-digital Jaeger, the nuclear-power
    ed Gipsy Danger is sent by Pentecost to help. Gipsy kills both Leatherback and O
    tachi. Chau and his team move in to harvest parts. Geiszler realizes one of the 
    Kaiju is pregnant; Chau and his crew are attacked by the newborn, which chokes o
    n its own umbilical cord after eating Chau. Geiszler and his colleague Hermann G
    ottlieb (Burn Gorman) merge with the baby Kaiju's intact brain, where they disco
    ver the secret controlling the flow of Kaijus through the portal.

The Jaeger fo
    rces reassemble to complete their plan to destroy the portal. Pentecost reveals 
    to Raleigh he is ill from radiation poisoning due to piloting a first-generation
     Jaeger alone to save a young Mako, and has been unable to pilot a Jaeger since.
     Pentecost takes command of Striker Eureka as one of its usual pilots Herc was i
    njured in the defense of Hong Kong.

Pentecost ventures into the ocean depths, w
    ith Raleigh and Mako supporting him. Geiszler and Gottlieb inform them the porta
    l has a fail-safe system to control the passage of Kaijus and will only allow th
    em to enter if they can mimic a Kaiju's genetic code. Two new Kaiju, Scunner and
     Raiju, are detected guarding the Breach, Gipsy and the repaired Striker, pilote
    d by Pentecost and Chuck, approach the Breach, where a new Category-5 Kaiju, Sla
    ttern, appears.

Before they can process this information, they are attacked by 
    the three Kaijus, including the largest on record, the category 5. When the Jaeg
    ers are attacked by the Kaiju, Gipsy kills Raiju, but is crippled. Pentecost and
     Chuck sacrifice themselves and Striker, killing Scunner. then Gipsy slaughters 
    Slattern, riding its corpse into the Breach.

Then Gipsy slaughters Slattern, ri
    ding its corpse into the Breach, intending to overload Gipsy Danger's nuclear re
    actors to use it as an improvised bomb. With the Jaeger critically damaged by th
    e fight, Raleigh ejects Mako and manually overrides the safety protocols before 
    ejecting himself. Gipsy Danger detonates on the other side of the portal, destro
    ying it and the alien commanders, as the two pilots emerge safely on the sea's s
    urface.

Chau-revealed to have survived-cuts his way out of the newborn Kaiju's 
    stomach.
outline:
    As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot 
    and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a de
    sperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.

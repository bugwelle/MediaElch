overview:
    The Bhais (Term used in India for Underworld Don's) and their goons are back aft
    er their mad performances in Welcome (2007 movie). Uday Shetty (Nana Patekar) an
    d Sagar Pandey "Majnu Bhai" (Anil Kapoor) have left the underworld, and are now 
    big businessmen settling in Dubai after being duped by Uday's brother-in-law Raj
    iv, but the two still remain unmarried. Things have changed to an extent that no
    w small-time dons like Badshah Khan (Neeraj Vora) are chasing the duo for protec
    tion money. Majnu wants to thrash them, but Uday says that one has to endure suc
    h things as honest businessmen and asks Majnu to pay Badshah.

Two women, Babita
     / Rajkumari Chandini (Ankita Shrivastava) and Poonam / Maharani Padmavati (Dimp
    le Kapadia), enter their life. Chandini is supposed to be a princess & Maharani 
    a queen, but in reality, both are con women and have served jail time in the pas
    t. They have been attracted by Uday and Majnu's wealth in Dubai. Chandini gains 
    the attention of the two men, thus getting them to finance her and Poonam's luxu
    rious lifestyle. Chandini is the new love in Uday Shetty and Majnu's life and bo
    th friends dream of tying the knot with her. Both Uday and Majnu shower Maharani
     and Chandini with expensive gifts which they use to maintain their lavish life 
    in Dubai.

When they realize that they both love the same girl, they decide that
     whoever has a better Kundli match with Chandini, will get to marry her.

Later,
     it is revealed that Uday has another sister Ranjana from his father, Shankar Sh
    etty's third marriage and Majnu and Uday are emotionally blackmailed by Shankar 
    into arranging the marriage of Ranjana (Shruti Haasan). He tells Uday Shetty to 
    get her married to someone from a good family. Maharani also puts on a condition
     that only after their sister is married will Chandini marry one of them. Now, a
     search to find a suitable husband for Ranjana starts.

Majnu & Uday reach out t
    o Dr Ghungroo (Paresh Rawal) again to help in the search of a boy from a good fa
    mily. Dr Ghungroo has just been made aware that his wife had an affair before he
    r marriage to him & has an illicit son from the affair. Unlike Rajiv who was dec
    ent, Ajju is brash and is a local goon of Mumbai, where Ranjana studies. Through
     a chain of hilarious events, they both fall in love with each other.

Dr Ghungr
    oo is on his way to meet him, when he is stopped by Majnu & Uday, who also learn
     that Ghungroo has a son & decide to marry Ranjana to him. Ghungroo tries to tel
    l them that he has never met his own son, but they don't listen. Ghungroo's son 
    turns out to be the Mumbai don Ajju Barsi (John Abraham). Ghungroo is afraid tha
    t Majnu & Uday will kill him if they realize that his son is a don.

But the tro
    ubles starts when Ranjana already has a boyfriend who is the same Ajay "Ajju" Ba
    rsi. Ajay turns himself into a nice boy to meet Uday & Majnu, who now go to Ghun
    groo to call off the marriage with his son. There they realize that Ajay is in f
    act Ghungroo's son. The wedding is back on, but Majnu suspects that Ajay is not 
    the nice boy he pretends to be. At the engagement party Ajay meets Maharani & Ch
    andini & recognizes then as the con-women from their previous job. At the same p
    arty, Majnu gets confirmation from his sources about the truth regarding Ajay. H
    e insults Ajay, but Ajay beats up Majnu's goons & declares that he will marry Ra
    njana, come what may.

Now Bhais have to get Ranjana married to a boy with non-c
    riminal background by avoiding Ajju and his temper so that they can get married 
    with the Chandini and while Dr. Ghunghroo has his own agenda.

To downplay Ajju'
    s threat to the wedding Uday & Majnu invite Wanted Bhai (Naseeruddin Shah) a bli
    nd don, to the function. It turns out that Wanted Bhai's son Honey (Shiney Ahuja
    ), is a drug addict & is in love with Ranjana, after seeing her once. He wants t
    o marry her at any cost but doesn't know who she is. Majnu & Uday escape but fin
    d that Wanted & Honey are attending the wedding at Ajju's invite, who has told t
    hem that Honey will meet the girl of his dreams at the wedding. At the wedding, 
    Ajju reveals Ranjana to Honey & Wanted Bhai takes the entire party to his privat
    e island.

Uday is angry and to counter Ajju, he announces his acceptance of Hon
    ey's wedding to Ranjana. Ajju instigates Chandini to have an affair with Honey. 
    Maharani agrees as she feels Wanted Bhai is a bigger party than Majnu & Uday. At
     the island, Ajju and Dr. Ghunguroo try to convince Honey that Honey no longer l
    oves Ranjana and that Babita is his true love. Meanwhile, Uday and Majnu try to 
    kill Ajju, but are frightened at the graveyard in a ghost act planned by Dr. Ghu
    nguroo, Ajju and Ranjana.

Uday & Majnu are depressed & drive away. Ranjana beli
    eves that they are driving away to suicide. She surrenders & says that she will 
    not wed against their wishes. Ajju also backs away from Ranjana for her happines
    s. Majnu & Uday realize that they truly love each other & give them their blessi
    ngs.

Unknown to all of them, their activities have been recorded by a CCTV came
    ra, causing Wanted Bhai and Honey to plan to finish them off. However, Honey is 
    kidnapped by all of them, and they escape towards the desert where they are chas
    ed by Wanted Bhai.

In the middle of saving himself, Dr. Ghunguroo pushes Wanted
     Bhai, causing him to faint. Meanwhile, a group of camels' marches heavily there
    . Ajju is successful in saving Wanted Bhai from the stampede of camels, and rest
    oring his sight. Wanted Bhai himself, as a form of gratitude, decides to arrange
     the marriage of Ajju with Ranjana, calling Ajju his 'second son'. However, they
     notice another sandstorm conjuring up, making everyone run for their lives.

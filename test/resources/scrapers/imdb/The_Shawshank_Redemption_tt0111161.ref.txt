originalTitle: The Shawshank Redemption
overview:
    In 1947, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker, is convicted of murdering his wi
    fe and her lover, a golf professional. He is sent to the notoriously harsh Shaws
    hank Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences, since the state of Maine ha
    s no death penalty. Andy keeps claiming his innocence, but his cold and calculat
    ing demeanor leads everyone to believe he did it.

Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman
    ), also known as Red, was a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence. Red is 
    being interviewed for parole after having spent 20 years at Shawshank for murder
    . Despite his best efforts and behavior, Red's parole is rejected which doesn't 
    phase him all that much.

An alarm goes off alerting all prisoners of new arriva
    ls. Red and his friends bet on whichever "new fish" will have a nervous break do
    wn during his first night in prison. Red places a huge bet on Andy. During the f
    irst night, an overweight newly arrived inmate, nicknamed ''fat ass', breaks dow
    n and cries hysterically allowing Heywood (William Sadler) to win the bet. Howev
    er, the celebration is short lived when the chief guard, Byron Hadley, savagely 
    beats up the fat man for not keeping quiet when he is asked to. Meanwhile, Andy 
    remains steadfast and composed. The next morning, the inmates learn that ''fat a
    ss'' died in the infirmary because the prison doctor had already left for the ni
    ght. Andy inquires about the man's name only to get put down by Heywood.

Though
     other prisoners consider Andy "a really cold fish," Red sees something in Andy,
     and likes him from the start. Andy approaches Red to smuggle a pick for him, an
     instrument he claims is necessary for his hobby of rock collecting and sculptin
    g. Red believes that Andy intends to use the pick for his escape. But then Red s
    ees how small the pick is.

Andy is beaten and sexually assaulted on a regular b
    asis by other stronger inmates led by Bogs Diamond (Mark Rolston). During the fi
    rst two years of his incarceration, Andy spends most of his time working in the 
    prison laundry or fighting off Boggs.

In 1949, when a work detail for tarring t
    he roof of one of the prison's buildings is announced, Red pulls some strings to
     get Andy and a few of their mutual friends assigned to the job, giving everyone
     a break from the usual routine and a chance to "enjoy" the fine weather. Andy o
    verhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed 
    on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. Andy informs
     Hadley of how he can shelter his money from the IRS by turning it into a one-ti
    me gift for his wife. He then offers to assist Hadley in filling out the paperwo
    rk in exchange for some cold beers for his fellow inmates while on the tarring j
    ob. Hadley first threatens to throw Andy off the roof, but eventually agrees and
     do provide the working inmates with cold beers before the job is finished. Red 
    remarks that Andy may have engineered the privilege to build favor with the pris
    on guards as much as with his fellow inmates, but he also thinks Andy did it sim
    ply to "feel normal again."

Andy then helps jailer Hadley (Clancy Brown) save t
    axes. While watching a movie, Andy approaches Red with another unusual demand an
    d asks for a large poster of the actress Rita Hayworth. Red is surprised by the 
    demand but agrees to place the order. As he exits the theater, Andy once more en
    counters his tormentors. Although he is able to talk his way out of being sexual
    ly assaulted, he is brutally beaten within an inch of his life, putting him in t
    he infirmary for a month. Boggs spends a week in solitary for the beating.

When
     he comes out, he finds Hadley and his men waiting in his cell. They beat him so
     badly that he's left unable to walk or eat solid food for the rest of his life 
    and is transferred to a prison hospital upstate. The Sisters move on and never b
    other Andy again. When Andy gets out of the infirmary, he finds a bunch of rocks
     for him to sculpt and a giant poster of Rita Hayworth in his cell; presents fro
    m Red and his friends.

Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) hears about how Andy h
    elped Hadley and uses a surprise cell inspection to size Andy up. He finds Andy 
    reading his copy of the Holy Bible and they talk about their favorite verses whi
    le the guards are turning the cell upside down looking for illegal possessions. 
    Satisfied with their encounter, the warden leaves and almost forget to give Andy
     his Bible back. He then encourages Andy to keep reading the Bible saying ''salv
    ation lays within''.

Warden Samuel Norton assigns Andy to the prison's decrepit
     library, ostensibly to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), bu
    t in reality, to leverage Andy's financial expertise for managing the finances o
    f the warden and other prison staff. Andy also starts writing weekly letters to 
    the state legislature, requesting funding to improve the library. His financial 
    support practice is so appreciated that even guards from other prisons, when the
    y visit for inter-prison baseball matches, seek Andy's financial expertise. Andy
    's client expands greatly and eventually includes Warden Norton himself.

Not lo
    ng after, Brooks suddenly snaps and threatens to kill Heywood in order to avoid 
    being paroled. Andy is able to talk him down. Brooks is paroled in 1954 after se
    rving 50 years, but cannot adjust to the outside world. Brooks goes to live in a
     halfway house. He is also given a job at a supermarket which he hates. Finding 
    it impossible to adjust to life outside the prison, he eventually commits suicid
    e, leaving the message "Brooks was here" carved on a wooden beam .

After years 
    of Andy's ceaseless letters, Andy receives $200 from the state for the library, 
    along with a collection of old books and phonograph records. The legislature sen
    ds a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy 
    plays an excerpt over the public address system, experiencing a moment of person
    al freedom before he is punished with solitary confinement. After his release fr
    om solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him throug
    h his sentence. Though the state Senate thinks this will be enough to get Andy t
    o halt his letter-writing campaign, he is undaunted and redoubles his efforts.


    Not long after, Red has a new parole hearing and realizes he's been in prison fo
    r 30 years now. He uses the exact same words he used ten years earlier only with
     no enthusiasm at all. His parole is rejected again. Andy gives him an harmonica
     to commemorate his 30 years which Red replies by offering Andy a giant poster o
    f Marilyn Monroe to commemorate his 10 years.

About four years after the Mozart
     incident, the state senate finally comes to the conclusion that they won't get 
    rid of Andy with just another check. So they allow him a budget of $500 a year t
    o expand the library, knocking down a few walls to unused rooms and renovating t
    he space as he'd planned with his incessant letter campaign. Andy uses the funds
     wisely and makes deals with book clubs and charities to create the best prison 
    library in the state and names it after Brooks. With the enlarged library and mo
    re materials, Andy begins to mentor inmates who want to receive their high schoo
    l diplomas so they can get decent jobs once they're out.

Warden Norton profits 
    on Andy's knowledge of bookkeeping and devises a scheme whereby he put prison in
    mates to work in public projects which he won by outbidding other contractors (c
    heap labor from the prisoners). Andy launders money for the warden, using a fake
     identity: "Randall Stephens". Randall Stephens officially has a birth certifica
    te, social security number and driver's license. Should anyone ever investigate 
    about the scheme; they will chase a man who only exists on paper. Andy shares th
    e details with Red, noting that he had to "go to prison to learn how to be a cro
    ok."

In 1965, Tommy (Gil Bellows) comes to Shawshank, a young inmate convicted 
    of burglary. When Tommy explains that he's been going in and out of prison ever 
    since he was 13 years old, Andy suggests that Tommy should consider another line
     of work besides theft because he seems to be not so good at it. The suggestion 
    really gets to Tommy, who is also a father to a young child, and he asks Andy to
     help him work on earning his high school equivalency diploma. Though Tommy is a
     good student, he is still frustrated when he takes the exam itself, crumpling i
    t up and tossing it in the trash. Andy retrieves it and sends it in anyway

Red 
    tells Tommy about Andy's case. Tommy is visibly upset at hearing Andy's story an
    d tells Andy and Red that he had a cellmate in another prison who boasted about 
    killing a man who was a professional golfer at the country club he worked at, al
    ong with his lover. The woman's husband, a banker, had gone to prison for those 
    murders.

When Andy informs Norton, the warden refuses to act. Although Andy pro
    mises to keep the money laundering a secret, the warden becomes furious and orde
    rs him to solitary for a month. The inmates discuss the sentence mentioning it i
    s the longest time in solitary that they've ever heard of. They also realize tha
    t Andy may truly be innocent after all and has spent almost 20 years in prison f
    or a crime he didn't commit.

Tommy receives a letter from the board of educatio
    n announcing that he has passed the exam and now owns a high school diploma. A g
    uard pass the news to Andy in his solitary cell which makes him smile a little.

    
One night, Tommy is escorted outside at night to have a private meeting with th
    e warden. Warden Norton asks him if the story he told Andy is true and if he wou
    ld be willing to testify on Andy's behalf. Tommy enthusiastically agrees. The wa
    rden smiles at him before nodding to Hadley to shoot him dead.

When the warden 
    visits Andy in solitary, he tells him that Tommy tried to escape and that Hadley
     had no choice but to shoot him. Andy doesn't buy that story and tells Norton th
    at ''everything'' stops and that he's not going to work for him anymore. The war
    den threatens Andy to shut down the library, burn all the books, and move Andy t
    o a much different cell in a much different part of the prison with the most har
    dened criminals should he stop working for him. He then leaves and orders Andy t
    o another month in solitary to think about things.

A disheveled Andy is release
    d from solitary confinement after two months. Andy tells Red if he's ever freed 
    or escapes, he'd like to go to Zihuatanejo, a beach town on the Pacific coast of
     Mexico. He also tells Red how he got engaged. He and his future wife went up to
     a farm in Buxton, Maine, to a large oak tree at the end of a stone wall. He tel
    ls Red that, if he should ever be paroled, he should look for that field, and th
    at oak tree. Red worries that Andy is suicidal, especially after learning that h
    e asked a fellow inmate for a rope.

The next day Andy escapes. At the next day'
    s roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at
     the poster hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel. Andy has used the pick
     to dig tiny amounts of dirt each to create the tunnel over 20 years.

The previ
    ous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking with h
    im Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing evidence of the money launder
    ing and corruption at Shawshank. Andy walks into the Maine National Bank in Port
    land, where he had put Warden Norton's money. Using his assumed identity as Rand
    all Stephens, and with all the necessary documentation, he walked out with a cas
    hier's check. He continues his visitations to nearly a dozen other local banks, 
    ending up with some $370,000. He also exposes Norton before disappearing. Hadley
     is arrested & Norton commits suicide.

At Red's next parole hearing in 1967, he
     talks to the parole board about how "rehabilitated" was a made-up word, and how
     he regretted his actions of the past. His parole is granted this time, but stru
    ggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering 
    his promise to Andy he follows Andy's instructions, hitchhiking to Buxton and ar
    riving at the stone wall Andy described. Just like Andy said, there was a large 
    black stone. Under it was a small box containing a large sum of cash and instruc
    tions to find him. He said he needed somebody "who could get things" for a "proj
    ect" of his.

Red violates parole and leaves the halfway house, unconcerned sinc
    e no one would really do an extensive manhunt for "an old crook like [him]." He 
    takes a bus to Fort Hancock, where he crosses into Mexico. The two friends are f
    inally reunited on the beach of Zihuatanejo on the Pacific coast, and share a ha
    ppy embrace.

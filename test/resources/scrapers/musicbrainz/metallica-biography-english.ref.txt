    Metallica is an American heavy metal band. It was formed in Los Angeles in 1981 
    by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based
     in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals 
    and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of th
    rash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup c
    omprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime 
    lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine

    y, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. 
Metallica fir
    st found commercial success with the release of its third album, Master of Puppe

     first Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, Metallica (1991), was a turning
     point for the band that saw them transition from their thrash roots; it appeale
    d to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and se
    lling more than 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the be
    st-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres
     and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal r

    Seasons, was released in 2023.

    t of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which 
    documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003),
     and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was 
    inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay f

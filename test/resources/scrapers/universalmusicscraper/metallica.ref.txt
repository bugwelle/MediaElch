name: Metallica
biography:
    Metallica is an American heavy metal band. It was formed in Los Angeles in 1981 
    by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based
     in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals 
    and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of th
    rash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup c
    omprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime 
    lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine
    , who formed Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists Ron McGovne
    y, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. 
Metallica fir
    st found commercial success with the release of its third album, Master of Puppe
    ts (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's bes
    t work. The band's next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its
     first Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, Metallica (1991), was a turning
     point for the band that saw them transition from their thrash roots; it appeale
    d to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and se
    lling more than 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the be
    st-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres
     and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal r
    oots with its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to t
    hat of the band's earlier albums. The band's eleventh and most recent album, 72 
    Seasons, was released in 2023. 
In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer
    -to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artis
    ts filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected mate
    rial without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subjec
    t of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which 
    documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003),
     and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was 
    inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay f
    or and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film Metallica: Through
     the Never, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyl
    ine. 
Metallica is one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, ha
    ving sold more than 163 million albums worldwide as of 2023, and is the third-be
    st-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, ha
    ving sold 58 million albums in the United States as of 2017. The band has releas
    ed eleven studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the S
    an Francisco Symphony), twelve video albums, one cover album, two extended plays
    , 37 singles and 39 music videos. Metallica has won ten Grammy Awards from 26 no
    minations and had six consecutive studio albums – from Metallica through Hardwir
    ed... to Self-Destruct (2016) – debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Metall
    ica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such

    st artists of all time.
